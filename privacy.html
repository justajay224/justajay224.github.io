    <h1>Privacy Policy for Cleanvid</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 30, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the https://justajay224.github.io application (hereby referred to as "Application") created by J Production (hereby referred to as "Service Provider"). This policy describes how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our Application, particularly information accessed through Google's YouTube API Services.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information from YouTube API Services (Google User Data)</h2>
    <p>The core functionality of our Application relies on the YouTube API Services. By authenticating your Google account, you grant the Application permission to access certain data from your YouTube account. Our commitment is to access only the data that is absolutely necessary for the Application to function as described.</p>

    <p>Below is a detailed breakdown of the Google user data we access and how we use it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Basic Google Profile Data (Name and Email Address)</strong><br>
            <strong>Data Accessed:</strong> Your name and email address associated with your Google Account.<br>
            <strong>How We Use It:</strong> This data is used exclusively to display the identity of the currently logged-in account within the "Account" tab. This helps you verify that you are signed in with the correct account. We do <strong>not</strong> store this information on our servers or share it with any third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Your YouTube Channel Data</strong><br>
            <strong>Data Accessed:</strong> Your YouTube Channel ID.<br>
            <strong>How We Use It:</strong> We use your Channel ID to identify which videos belong to you. This is necessary for the "Fast Clean" feature and to differentiate between deleting your own comments versus rejecting others' comments.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>List of Videos on Your Channel</strong><br>
            <strong>Data Accessed:</strong> A list of video IDs from the public "uploads" playlist on your channel.<br>
            <strong>How We Use It:</strong> The application accesses this list solely for the "Fast Clean" feature to scan your 5 most recent videos for spam comments.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Video Comment Data</strong><br>
            <strong>Data Accessed:</strong> The text of comments, comment IDs, and the channel ID of the comment author on videos you select.<br>
            <strong>How We Use It:</strong> Comment data is analyzed locally on your device to detect spam. Based on your command, the application sends requests back to the YouTube API to delete or reject the comments you have selected.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Storage and Sharing of Google User Data</h3>
    <p><strong>Storage:</strong> All data accessed from the YouTube API is processed only on your device (on-device) and is <strong>never</strong> permanently stored on our servers. This data resides only in your device's memory while the application is in use.</p>
    <p><strong>Sharing:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> share any user data received from the YouTube API Services with any third-party services.</p>
    
    <h3>Limited Use Compliance</h3>
    <p>The Application's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2>3. Automatically Collected Information (Non-Personal Data)</h2>
    <p>When you use the Application, we may use third-party services, such as Google Play Services, that collect aggregated, anonymous usage data for analytics and application improvement. This information may include your device's IP address, operating system, and application usage statistics. This data is fully anonymized and **does not include any personal information or any data accessed from your YouTube account.**</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Retention and Opt-Out</h2>
    <p>We do not store your personal data or Google user data on our servers. All data from the Google API exists only temporarily on your device while the application is running. You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the Application. If you wish to revoke the Application's access to your Google Account, you can do so at any time from your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Account's security settings page</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Application is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take necessary action.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information and provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information we process and maintain.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
